This is the README file for PAR, a toolkit to create and use perl scripts
and modules stored inside compressed .par files.

Please type "perldoc PAR" after installation to see the module usage
information, and "perldoc PAR::FAQ" for frequently answered questions.

For running ".par" files directly, please install PAR-Packer and
see "perldoc parl".

To generate/execute self-contained perl scripts, install PAR-Packer
and see "perldoc par.pl" or "perldoc pp".

An extensive "Cross-Platform Packaging and Deployment with PAR" tutorial
is available as "perldoc PAR::Tutorial".  A slightly outdated version is
also available online at <http://www.autrijus.org/par-tutorial/>.

* Installation

PAR uses the standard perl module install process:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

* Historic note

With version 0.97 of PAR, the logic for generating stand-alone executables
has been refactored into the PAR-Packer distribution. It should be available
from the same source you got PAR from. Hence, for packing scripts with
prerequisite modules into stand-alone scripts or executables
(aka PerlApp, Perl2exe, or 'perlcc that works'), see "perldoc pp"
and "perldoc tkpp".

Since version 0.97 of PAR, you do not need a C compiler any more to build it.
All logic that required a C compiler previously was moved into the PAR-Packer
distribution.
